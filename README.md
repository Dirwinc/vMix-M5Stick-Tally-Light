## Getting started: Uploading the code to the stick

### Video tutorial
[![Video Tutoral](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uB_OkMGLoto/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB_OkMGLoto "How to update the firmware of the M5Stick C to the Tally Light project")

### Step 1
1.1  Follow the tutorial on the [M5Stack website](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/arduino/arduino_development).

1.2  Copy the libraries that are used by this project (found in the `libs` folder) to your system. The default path is: `%userprofile%\Documents\Arduino\libraries`

### Step 2
Upload to your device.

### Step 3
Follow the instructions on the LCD.

### Step 4
Enjoy ðŸ˜„

## Configuring the stick
1. Once the code is uploaded to the stick, wait until it's in AP (Access Point) mode.
2. Grab a phone and connect to the `vMix-M5Stick-Tally` wifi network, the password is: `12345678`.
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://192.168.4.1`, this will open up the Web UI.
	1. Enter the SSID of the wifi network you want to connect to.
	2. Enter the password that corresponds to the SSID.
	3. Enter the IP Address of the PC that's running vMix.
	4. Specify the input number that the stick must listen to. (This is the little number in the top left corner of every input)
4. Hit the save button.
5. The stick will restart with the given information. If you changed the wifi settings, it's recommended to manually reboot the stick (turn off and on again).
